# OpenTechSchool Leipzig Learning Resources

In this repository we collect learning resources for programming and software development. We only add resources that are recommended by someone we trust or we have made good experiences with.

**Note:**
For collecting the resources we misuse the GitHub issue tracker for practial reasons. So please note, that this is *not* the way an issue tracker is supposed to be used! If you are interested what an issue tracker is used for and how you can use it in your projects, see the GitHub Guide for [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

# How to find resources

Open [the tab "Issues"](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool-Leipzig/learning-resources/issues) and you will see a list of learning resources.
We added labels, so you can filter the list according to your needs.

If you like or dislike a resource please give a comment. If you have any other remarks or questions, please add them directly to the learning resource.
